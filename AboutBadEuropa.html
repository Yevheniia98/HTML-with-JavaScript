    <p id="w" style= "display:none">Native Americans, also known as American Indians, First Americans, Indigenous Americans, and other terms, are the Indigenous peoples of the mainland United States .  As defined by the United States Census, "Native Americans" are Indigenous tribes that are originally from the contiguous United States, along with Alaska Natives. Indigenous peoples of the United States who are not listed as American Indian or Alaska Native include Native Hawaiians, Samoan Americans, and Chamorros.  <br><br>

   <mark>European colonization of the Americas, which began in 1492, resulted in a precipitous decline in Native American population because of new diseases (including weaponized diseases and biological warfare by European colonizers), wars, ethnic cleansing, and enslavement.</mark> After its formation, the United States, as part of its policy of settler colonialism, continued to wage war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples, removed them from their ancestral lands, and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies , later focused on forced assimilation, into the 20th century.<br> Since the 1960s, Native American self-determination movements have resulted in positive changes to the lives of many Native Americans, though there are still many contemporary issues faced by them.</p>
